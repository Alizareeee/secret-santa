## How to make it work on your machine
- Assumptions: You have 'Linux like terminal', `node` and `yarn` on your machine
- Clone the repository on your computer
- Run `yarn` in the `root directory`, and in the `app` directory of the project to get all of the dependencies.
- You need a `config` folder inside project `root`, and inside `config` should be two files `config.js` and `development.json. I can't put the here due to sensitive data.
- Type `npm start` or `node server.js` in the working directory shell.
- Go to your browser and type `localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3000/`
